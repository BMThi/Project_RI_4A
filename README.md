# Aerosol Typing Project Using LIDAR Data

## Introduction

We are a team of students at [INSA Toulouse](http://www.insa-toulouse.fr/) conducting a research project under the guidance of our mentor, Romain Ceolato, at [ONERA](http://onera.fr/). Our project applies machine learning techniques to the classification of aerosols using LIDAR data.

## Project Description

The aim of our project is to develop an effective aerosol typing method using the DELIAN dataset, which comprises a wealth of experimental data on the optical properties of aerosols.

## Current Progress

1. **Literature Review**: We have reviewed a variety of scientific publications to identify the most suitable machine learning methods for our aerosol typing endeavor.
2. **Algorithm Development**: We are programming several promising machine learning algorithms in Python.
3. **Evaluation**: We are evaluating these algorithms to determine their effectiveness and precision.
4. **Reporting**: We will compile our research and analysis into a comprehensive report that will document our findings.
